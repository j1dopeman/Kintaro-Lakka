# Kintaro-Lakka

Version 1

Thanks to Michael Kirsch & Marcelo Novaes

I just frankensteined their two solutions together and it works great!

This is the Kintaro script for Lakka.

To install this script you do the following steps:

1.Connect with SSH  
2.Then copy the ```.config/autostart.sh``` into ```/storage/.config/```  
3.Copy the ```lib``` folder into ```/storage/```  
4.Copy the ```scripts``` folder into ```/storage/```  
5.reboot
